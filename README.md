## About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Antonia Sunseri a Data Scientist based in Pittsburgh, PA. I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics from Saint Vincent College and am continuing my education at the University of Denver for my M.S Data Science. I am a highly motivated individual who always loves to learn new technologies and solve problems. I focus on analyzing large sets of data and creating machine learning models with the goal to help businesses to make better decisions. I have experience in: 

â€¢ Python 
â€¢ R
â€¢ Data Cleaning 
â€¢ Data Visualization 
â€¢ Machine Learning
â€¢ Statistical Analysis 

ðŸ“š I attended and graduated from Saint Vincent College with a B.S Mathematics and minor in Data Analytics. While finishing my last year in undergrad, I joined the PA Auditor General as an IT Audit Intern. Throughout my time at Saint Vincent College, I developed a strong passion for learning new technologies. As a result, I decided to shift into the Data Science industry. My love for analyzing big data, coding, and my willingness to help other people have shaped me as a person and will hopefully transpire to help me reach my career goals.
